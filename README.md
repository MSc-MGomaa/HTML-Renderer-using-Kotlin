# HTML-Renderer-using-Kotlin
Many websites are generated by programs. To support this, it is your task to develop a class system that is able to build simple HTML structures.

## Main components
<p align="justify">
The classes in this system (Text, Paragraph, Heading, Div, HTMLList, ListItem) represent different HTML elements / parts of a website. These classes are leaves in the type hierarchy and should be implemented as data classes.
<p align="justify">
The intermediate parts of the inheritance hierarchy are expressed by five interfaces (Element, TaggedElement, TextElement, TaggedTextElement, ContainerElement), all of which should be implemented as sealed interfaces, which allows the compiler to perform exhaustiveness-checks in when-expressions.
